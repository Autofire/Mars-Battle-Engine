These files need to be imported into RPGVXA in the order that they are presented. I would recommend using the [Gemini IDE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geminieditor/) to do this. Note that these these scripts must fall between "Materials" and "Main Process" to function correctly. If you use Luna, it may be wise to place them before Luna, as well, but I am not sure if this is required.

Any empty files don't need to be imported but they are there to space scripts out and make it easier to read.
