These files need to be imported into RPGVXA in the order that they are
presented. I would recommend using the [Gemini
IDE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geminieditor/) to do this. Note that these
these scripts must fall between "Materials" and "Main Process" to function
correctly. If you use Luna, it may be wise to place them before Luna, as well,
but I am not sure if this is required.

Any empty files don't need to be imported but they are there to space scripts
out and make it easier to read.

Please note that this repo is *not* kept perfectly up to date! Due to the way
RPGMakerVXA handles its scripts, it is a royal pain to dump the scripts into
this folder. (As in, I have to export ALL scripts in the projects, copy only
the ones for MaBE, and then rename each file, one at a time.)

It should be really straightforward to make a script to do this automatically,
but I haven't done so yet. If I do ever get around to making this, I will make
sure to add it to the repo.
