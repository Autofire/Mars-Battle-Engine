# About

This is a side project of mine. I'm juggling it between school, my own projects,
and everything else in my life. It's mainly for my younger brother, who likes
RMVX Ace, but wants to be able to do more with the battle system.

For more info, check the files with the unicode arrows. (Yes, I have unicode in
the filenames. I know this is awful but this is how RMVX Ace handles its
scripts.)


# Installing and Maitainence

These files need to be imported into RPGVXA in the order that they are
presented. I would recommend using the [Gemini
IDE](https://sourceforge.net/projects/geminieditor/) to do this. Note that these
these scripts must fall between "Materials" and "Main Process" to function
correctly. If you use Luna, it may be wise to place them before Luna, as well,
but I am not sure if this is required.

Any empty files don't need to be imported but they are there to space scripts
out and make it easier to read.

Please note that this repo is *not* kept perfectly up to date! Due to the way
RMVX Ace handles its scripts, I cannot easily keep them all in my Github repo
while working on them. Neither can I give them nice, space-free and Unicode-free
names all of the time. However, I assure you that Gemini will properly import
the files.
