			#	All possible actions to choose from.
			#	
			#		Array<String> words
			#	The first word is always the rule, while subsequent values (if any) are
			#	arguments.
			#
			# 	Returns:
			#	RPG::Enemy::Action	- Implies action to be run
			# int									- Implies line to jump to
			# nil									- This rule didn't trigger anything; try the next one
			# anything else				- Yields undefined behaviour
